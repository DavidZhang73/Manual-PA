    r"""Compute grid sample.

    Given an :attr:`input` and a flow-field :attr:`grid`, computes the
    ``output`` using :attr:`input` values and pixel locations from :attr:`grid`.

    Currently, only spatial (4-D) and volumetric (5-D) :attr:`input` are
    supported.

    In the spatial (4-D) case, for :attr:`input` with shape
    :math:`(N, C, H_\text{in}, W_\text{in})` and :attr:`grid` with shape
    :math:`(N, H_\text{out}, W_\text{out}, 2)`, the output will have shape
    :math:`(N, C, H_\text{out}, W_\text{out})`.

    For each output location ``output[n, :, h, w]``, the size-2 vector
    ``grid[n, h, w]`` specifies :attr:`input` pixel locations ``x`` and ``y``,
    which are used to interpolate the output value ``output[n, :, h, w]``.
    In the case of 5D inputs, ``grid[n, d, h, w]`` specifies the
    ``x``, ``y``, ``z`` pixel locations for interpolating
    ``output[n, :, d, h, w]``. :attr:`mode` argument specifies ``nearest`` or
    ``bilinear`` interpolation method to sample the input pixels.

    :attr:`grid` specifies the sampling pixel locations normalized by the
    :attr:`input` spatial dimensions. Therefore, it should have most values in
    the range of ``[-1, 1]``. For example, values ``x = -1, y = -1`` is the
    left-top pixel of :attr:`input`, and values  ``x = 1, y = 1`` is the
    right-bottom pixel of :attr:`input`.

    If :attr:`grid` has values outside the range of ``[-1, 1]``, the corresponding
    outputs are handled as defined by :attr:`padding_mode`. Options are

        * ``padding_mode="zeros"``: use ``0`` for out-of-bound grid locations,
        * ``padding_mode="border"``: use border values for out-of-bound grid locations,
        * ``padding_mode="reflection"``: use values at locations reflected by
          the border for out-of-bound grid locations. For location far away
          from the border, it will keep being reflected until becoming in bound,
          e.g., (normalized) pixel location ``x = -3.5`` reflects by border ``-1``
          and becomes ``x' = 1.5``, then reflects by border ``1`` and becomes
          ``x'' = -0.5``.

    Note:
        This function is often used in conjunction with :func:`affine_grid`
        to build `Spatial Transformer Networks`_ .

    Note:
        When using the CUDA backend, this operation may induce nondeterministic
        behaviour in its backward pass that is not easily switched off.
        Please see the notes on :doc:`/notes/randomness` for background.

    Note:
        NaN values in :attr:`grid` would be interpreted as ``-1``.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): input of shape :math:`(N, C, H_\text{in}, W_\text{in})` (4-D case)
                        or :math:`(N, C, D_\text{in}, H_\text{in}, W_\text{in})` (5-D case)
        grid (Tensor): flow-field of shape :math:`(N, H_\text{out}, W_\text{out}, 2)` (4-D case)
                       or :math:`(N, D_\text{out}, H_\text{out}, W_\text{out}, 3)` (5-D case)
        mode (str): interpolation mode to calculate output values
            ``'bilinear'`` | ``'nearest'`` | ``'bicubic'``. Default: ``'bilinear'``
            Note: ``mode='bicubic'`` supports only 4-D input.
            When ``mode='bilinear'`` and the input is 5-D, the interpolation mode
            used internally will actually be trilinear. However, when the input is 4-D,
            the interpolation mode will legitimately be bilinear.
        padding_mode (str): padding mode for outside grid values
            ``'zeros'`` | ``'border'`` | ``'reflection'``. Default: ``'zeros'``
        align_corners (bool, optional): Geometrically, we consider the pixels of the
            input  as squares rather than points.
            If set to ``True``, the extrema (``-1`` and ``1``) are considered as referring
            to the center points of the input's corner pixels. If set to ``False``, they
            are instead considered as referring to the corner points of the input's corner
            pixels, making the sampling more resolution agnostic.
            This option parallels the ``align_corners`` option in
            :func:`interpolate`, and so whichever option is used here
            should also be used there to resize the input image before grid sampling.
            Default: ``False``

    Returns:
        output (Tensor): output Tensor

    .. warning::
        When ``align_corners = True``, the grid positions depend on the pixel
        size relative to the input image size, and so the locations sampled by
        :func:`grid_sample` will differ for the same input given at different
        resolutions (that is, after being upsampled or downsampled).
        The default behavior up to version 1.2.0 was ``align_corners = True``.
        Since then, the default behavior has been changed to ``align_corners = False``,
        in order to bring it in line with the default for :func:`interpolate`.

    .. note::
        ``mode='bicubic'`` is implemented using the `cubic convolution algorithm`_ with :math:`\alpha=-0.75`.
        The constant :math:`\alpha` might be different from packages to packages.
        For example, `PIL`_ and `OpenCV`_ use -0.5 and -0.75 respectively.
        This algorithm may "overshoot" the range of values it's interpolating.
        For example, it may produce negative values or values greater than 255 when interpolating input in [0, 255].
        Clamp the results with :func:`torch.clamp` to ensure they are within the valid range.

    pad(input, pad, mode="constant", value=None) -> Tensor

    Pads tensor.

    Padding size:
        The padding size by which to pad some dimensions of :attr:`input`
        are described starting from the last dimension and moving forward.
        :math:`\left\lfloor\frac{\text{len(pad)}}{2}\right\rfloor` dimensions
        of ``input`` will be padded.
        For example, to pad only the last dimension of the input tensor, then
        :attr:`pad` has the form
        :math:`(\text{padding\_left}, \text{padding\_right})`;
        to pad the last 2 dimensions of the input tensor, then use
        :math:`(\text{padding\_left}, \text{padding\_right},`
        :math:`\text{padding\_top}, \text{padding\_bottom})`;
        to pad the last 3 dimensions, use
        :math:`(\text{padding\_left}, \text{padding\_right},`
        :math:`\text{padding\_top}, \text{padding\_bottom}`
        :math:`\text{padding\_front}, \text{padding\_back})`.

    Padding mode:
        See :class:`torch.nn.CircularPad2d`, :class:`torch.nn.ConstantPad2d`,
        :class:`torch.nn.ReflectionPad2d`, and :class:`torch.nn.ReplicationPad2d`
        for concrete examples on how each of the padding modes works. Constant
        padding is implemented for arbitrary dimensions. Circular, replicate and
        reflection padding are implemented for padding the last 3 dimensions of a
        4D or 5D input tensor, the last 2 dimensions of a 3D or 4D input tensor,
        or the last dimension of a 2D or 3D input tensor.

            Default: ``'constant'``
        value: fill value for ``'constant'`` padding. Default: ``0``

    ensure embedding dimension uniformity in the projected outputs.
    Output is a triple containing projection tensors for query, key and value.

    Args:
        q, k, v: query, key and value tensors to be projected.
        w_q, w_k, w_v: weights for q, k and v, respectively.
        b_q, b_k, b_v: optional biases for q, k and v, respectively.

        Inputs:
        - q: :math:`(Qdims..., Eq)` where Eq is the query embedding dimension and Qdims are any
            number of leading dimensions.
        - k: :math:`(Kdims..., Ek)` where Ek is the key embedding dimension and Kdims are any
            number of leading dimensions.
        - v: :math:`(Vdims..., Ev)` where Ev is the value embedding dimension and Vdims are any
            number of leading dimensions.

    r"""Forward method for MultiHeadAttention.

    See :class:`torch.nn.MultiheadAttention` for details.

    Args:
        query, key, value: map a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output.
            See "Attention Is All You Need" for more details.
        embed_dim_to_check: total dimension of the model.
        num_heads: parallel attention heads.
        in_proj_weight, in_proj_bias: input projection weight and bias.
        bias_k, bias_v: bias of the key and value sequences to be added at dim=0.
        add_zero_attn: add a new batch of zeros to the key and
                       value sequences at dim=1.
        dropout_p: probability of an element to be zeroed.
        out_proj_weight, out_proj_bias: the output projection weight and bias.
        training: apply dropout if is ``True``.
        key_padding_mask: if provided, specified padding elements in the key will
            be ignored by the attention. This is an binary mask. When the value is True,
            the corresponding value on the attention layer will be filled with -inf.
        need_weights: output attn_output_weights.
            Default: `True`
            Note: `needs_weight` defaults to `True`, but should be set to `False`
            For best performance when attention weights are not needed.
            *Setting needs_weights to `True`
            leads to a significant performance degradation.*
        attn_mask: 2D or 3D mask that prevents attention to certain positions. A 2D mask will be broadcasted for all
            the batches while a 3D mask allows to specify a different mask for the entries of each batch.
        is_causal: If specified, applies a causal mask as attention mask, and ignores
            attn_mask for computing scaled dot product attention.
            Default: ``False``.
            .. warning::
                is_causal is provides a hint that the attn_mask is the
                causal mask.Providing incorrect hints can result in
                incorrect execution, including forward and backward
                compatibility.
        use_separate_proj_weight: the function accept the proj. weights for query, key,
            and value in different forms. If false, in_proj_weight will be used, which is
            a combination of q_proj_weight, k_proj_weight, v_proj_weight.
        q_proj_weight, k_proj_weight, v_proj_weight, in_proj_bias: input projection weight and bias.
        static_k, static_v: static key and value used for attention operators.
        average_attn_weights: If true, indicates that the returned ``attn_weights`` should be averaged across heads.
            Otherwise, ``attn_weights`` are provided separately per head. Note that this flag only has an effect
            when ``need_weights=True.``. Default: True


    Shape:
        Inputs:
        - query: :math:`(L, E)` or :math:`(L, N, E)` where L is the target sequence length, N is the batch size, E is
          the embedding dimension.
        - key: :math:`(S, E)` or :math:`(S, N, E)`, where S is the source sequence length, N is the batch size, E is
          the embedding dimension.
        - value: :math:`(S, E)` or :math:`(S, N, E)` where S is the source sequence length, N is the batch size, E is
          the embedding dimension.
        - key_padding_mask: :math:`(S)` or :math:`(N, S)` where N is the batch size, S is the source sequence length.
          If a FloatTensor is provided, it will be directly added to the value.
          If a BoolTensor is provided, the positions with the
          value of ``True`` will be ignored while the position with the value of ``False`` will be unchanged.
        - attn_mask: 2D mask :math:`(L, S)` where L is the target sequence length, S is the source sequence length.
          3D mask :math:`(N*num_heads, L, S)` where N is the batch size, L is the target sequence length,
          S is the source sequence length. attn_mask ensures that position i is allowed to attend the unmasked
          positions. If a BoolTensor is provided, positions with ``True``
          are not allowed to attend while ``False`` values will be unchanged. If a FloatTensor
          is provided, it will be added to the attention weight.
        - static_k: :math:`(N*num_heads, S, E/num_heads)`, where S is the source sequence length,
          N is the batch size, E is the embedding dimension. E/num_heads is the head dimension.
        - static_v: :math:`(N*num_heads, S, E/num_heads)`, where S is the source sequence length,
          N is the batch size, E is the embedding dimension. E/num_heads is the head dimension.

        Outputs:
        - attn_output: :math:`(L, E)` or :math:`(L, N, E)` where L is the target sequence length, N is the batch size,
          E is the embedding dimension.
        - attn_output_weights: Only returned when ``need_weights=True``. If ``average_attn_weights=True``, returns
          attention weights averaged across heads of shape :math:`(L, S)` when input is unbatched or
          :math:`(N, L, S)`, where :math:`N` is the batch size, :math:`L` is the target sequence length, and
          :math:`S` is the source sequence length. If ``average_attn_weights=False``, returns attention weights per
          head of shape :math:`(num_heads, L, S)` when input is unbatched or :math:`(N, num_heads, L, S)`.
